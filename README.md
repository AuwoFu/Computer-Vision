# ComputerVision_Practice
This is a personal project for course "Computer Vision".
It implements some image processes including "gray level", "negative image", "Gaussian Blur", "Mosaic" and offers other features which can use for camera, such as "Mosaic the Face automatically" and "Using the Mask to cover the face".
